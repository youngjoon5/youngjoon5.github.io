                <h1> Political Economy for Resilient Coupled Infrastructure Systems </h1>
                            <p>  </p>
                            Governance to create a resilient coupled infrastructure system is of interest to me. 
                            Due to the system's high interdependence and climate change, infrastructure systems are becoming increasingly vulnerable. 
                            Infrastructure must be repaired, upgraded, and rebuilt to ensure its resilience. 
                            Despite failures, however, it is difficult to make appropriate decisions and investments in the systems. 
                            To solve this puzzle, we must consider the intricate dynamics of political economy regarding the social-technical value of infrastructure's shared resources.
                            In addition, it is crucial to assess the inherent risks and limitations of the system by analyzing intra- and inter-organizations. 
                            I believe social simulation modeling and network theory can provide useful frameworks for modeling resilient governance systems.<p></p>

                My main interest is about Crisis, Recovery, and the effects of Policies in the complex adaptive system. <p></p>
                We have experienced several crises which shook the world or some regions. 
                The 2008 Financial crisis was one of them. The impact was the most serious since the Great depression. 
                It is just the Black swan? Otherwise, the Dragon King ?
                Is it different from other crises?<p></p>   
                It has affected and changed many things in economic, political and social institutions. 
                Policy makers want to restore economies and societies.
                However, advanced countires have suffered from slow economic recovery and increasing inequality. 
                Are there any problems in governments' policies for recovery? Are they insufficient or inappropriate?  <p></p>
                Whatever you answer, you will confront the weaknesses of conventional models and recovery policies. This is my starting point of my research.

                I completed my dissertation in 2015. My dissertation contains three models.<p></p>
                The first one is for systemic risks in random networks and power-law networks. I suggest a crisis is a very-rare-but-extremely dangerous event.
                The second one is called "Hidden spread of systemic risk model". It shows the spread patterns of systemic risks in the multiple networks,and the pop-corn effect.
                Finally, I provide an explanation about the slow recovery after the 2008 financial crisis. My model is an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game in a network.
                or a graphical PD game.<p></p>
            
                <p>You can watch video clips about the models in my YouTube channel. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8aCUQu3pE3x96QN2HjosHA"> My Dissertation Model</a> </p>

                We are interconnected with others. My current behavior can affect future or current behaviors of my neighbors. 
                This interconnectedness creates complexity. In the complex system, there are no static equilibrium and representative agent. This seems to be more realistic.<p></p>
                Macro-social phenomena are emergent through interactions of heterogenous agents. We can easily find examples for it, such as GDP, voting results, conflicts, etc.<p></p>  
                Ond of the famous examples is the tragedy of commons. 
                This tragedy emerges from interactions of agents who NEVER want this result. Regardless of the agents' aims, the unexpected outcome can occur.
                Let's focus on macro-behavior through micro-motives. Crisis and Recovery are also collective phenomena of the macro-behaviors. Although no one wants a crisis and all want a fast recovery, 
                the collective phenomena of the agents are often unexpected. It is the nature of the complex system. I think we can find better explnations and predictions to our current issues of the inter-dependent world.
                I created a simple Netlogo model for the tragedy of commons. <p><a href="http://modelingcommons.org/browse/one_model/3942#model_tabs_browse_info"> Tragedy of Commons model</a> </p> <!-- <a href="files/tragedy of commons(ver.4.2).html">-->

            Many human-made systems are based on networks. Anything can be a node of a network such as individual, institution, country, etc. 
            Thus, the concepts of the network theory can be extended to trade, traffics, idea and innovation spread, finance, macro-economic networks, contagion,and etc. I am using Gephi, R, and Python as the network analysis tools. <p></p>

            The avobe figure shows relationships of the Renaissance notable figures.

            This figure is my Facebook network. There are one giant component and four small sub-networks. By the shapes of networks, each node's behavior can be different. 
            Through this network, We can get information to interconnted patterns of my friends. <p></p>
